```python
# Initialize the matrix
matrix = [[2, 1, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 8, 9]]

# Initialize variables
M = len(matrix)
N = len(matrix[0])
prevRow = matrix[0][:]

# Iterate through rows starting from the second row (r = 1)
for r in range(1, M):
    currRow = [0] * N  # Initialize the current row
    
    # Iterate through columns
    for c in range(N):
        curr = matrix[r][c]
        
        # Calculate the three possible paths: top, top-left, top-right
        top = curr + prevRow[c]
        topL = curr + prevRow[c - 1] if c > 0 else float('inf')
        topR = curr + prevRow[c + 1] if c < N - 1 else float('inf')
        
        # Choose the minimum path and update the current row
        currRow[c] = min(top, topL, topR)
    
    prevRow = currRow  # Update the previous row with the current row

# Return the minimum falling path sum
return min(prevRow)
```

Now, let's break down the steps with the given matrix:

1. **Initial Matrix:**
   ```
   [[2, 1, 3],
    [6, 5, 4],
    [7, 8, 9]]
   ```

2. **Iteration 1 (r = 1):**
   - Calculate the minimum falling path sum for each cell in the second row based on the values in the first row.
   - Update `currRow` with the minimum path sums: `[7, 6, 8]`

3. **Iteration 2 (r = 2):**
   - Calculate the minimum falling path sum for each cell in the third row based on the values in the second row.
   - Update `currRow` with the minimum path sums: `[13, 15, 13]`

4. **Result:**
   - The final result is the minimum value in the last row, which is `min([13, 15, 13]) = 13`.

So, the minimum falling path sum for the given matrix is 13.


## More explaination:
Let's see the explanation for the given matrix `[[2, 1, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 8, 9]]`:

1. **Iteration 1 (r=1):**
   - `currRow = [0, 0, 0]` (initialized with zeros)
   - For `c=0`:
     - Calculate `top = 6 + 2 = 8`
     - Calculate `topR = 6 + 3 = 9` (since `c=0`, the right neighbor is at `c+1=1`)
     - Update `currRow[0] = min(8, 9) = 8`
   - For `c=1`:
     - Calculate `top = 5 + 1 = 6`
     - Calculate `topL = 5 + 2 = 7`
     - Calculate `topR = 5 + 3 = 8` (since `c=1`, the right neighbor is at `c+1=2`)
     - Update `currRow[1] = min(6, 7, 8) = 6`
   - For `c=2`:
     - Calculate `top = 4 + 3 = 7`
     - Calculate `topL = 4 + 1 = 5`
     - Calculate `topR = 4 + float('inf')` (since `c=2`, there is no right neighbor)
     - Update `currRow[2] = min(7, 5, float('inf')) = 5`
   - Update `prevRow = [8, 6, 5]`

2. **Iteration 2 (r=2):**
   - `currRow = [0, 0, 0]` (initialized with zeros)
   - For `c=0`:
     - Calculate `top = 7 + 8 = 15`
     - Calculate `topR = 7 + 6 = 13`
     - Update `currRow[0] = min(15, 13) = 13`
   - For `c=1`:
     - Calculate `top = 8 + 6 = 14`
     - Calculate `topL = 8 + 8 = 16`
     - Calculate `topR = 8 + 5 = 13`
     - Update `currRow[1] = min(14, 16, 13) = 13`
   - For `c=2`:
     - Calculate `top = 9 + 5 = 14`
     - Calculate `topL = 9 + 6 = 15`
     - Calculate `topR = 9 + float('inf')` (since `c=2`, there is no right neighbor)
     - Update `currRow[2] = min(14, 15, float('inf')) = 14`
   - Update `prevRow = [13, 13, 14]`

3. The minimum falling path sum is the minimum value in the last row of `prevRow`, which is `13`.

So, the minimum falling path sum for the given matrix `[[2, 1, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 8, 9]]` is `13`.
